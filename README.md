# 🩺 Stroke Prediction using Machine Learning  

## 📌 Project Description  
This project predicts the likelihood of a stroke based on **demographic, health, and lifestyle factors**. Using machine learning models, we processed the dataset, handled class imbalances, performed feature selection, and optimized hyperparameters to improve predictive performance.  

## 📂 Dataset  
- **training.csv** – Contains patient data with features such as age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, BMI, smoking status, and more.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data Processing  
- **Scikit-Learn** – Machine Learning  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data Visualization  

## 🚀 How to Run  
1. **Clone the repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AmirhosseinGhalaei/Stroke-Prediction.git

    Navigate to the project folder:

cd Stroke-Prediction

Install required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Python script:

    python StrokePrediction.py

📊 Features & Steps

✔ Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical data
✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding distributions, correlations
✔ Class Imbalance Handling: Using SMOTE or re-sampling
✔ Feature Engineering & Selection: Selecting the most relevant features
✔ Model Training: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.
✔ Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing models for better accuracy
